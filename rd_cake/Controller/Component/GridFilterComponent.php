    /*INFO: We created this Component when we did the upgrade from ExtJs 4 to ExtJs 6 in order to fix the filter on the grids
    //In version 4 the filter was in the form: (object with the following properties 
        -> type [date|string|boolean] 
        -> value (for string and boolean)
        -> comparison (for date)
        -> value
        -> field
    In version 6 the filter change COMPLETELY and we now have:
        -> operator (Based on the value of the Operator, we will specify the type which in now not present any more)
        -> property (This now contains the field)
        -> value
    
    We use the following rules when looking at the value of operator to decide the type that will be used:
        like => string; = => boolean; gt,lt,eq => date
