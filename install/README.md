RADIUSdesk Installer & Coova-chill
====================
## Overview
This project tries to simplify or ease the process of getting a working installation of [RADIUSdesk](http://www.radiusdesk.com) on a vanilla/minimal installation of RHEL/CentOS 6.X/Ubuntu 13.10/14.04 (64 bit). This will be an ongoing effort and there is plans to support more Distros (like openSUSE etc) and so please feel free to contribute by sending a pull request.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the project.

   a) If you have git already installed, just use `git clone git clone https://github.com/smartwifi/rd_wifi`. **Note:** you can install git on RHEL/CentOS 6.x via yum (`yum install -y git`)
   
   b) If you prefer to download the zip file `wget -cL https://github.com/smartwifi/rd_wifi/archive/master.zip`. **Note:** just make sure you have **wget** and **unzip** installed (`yum install -y wget unzip`)
2. Run/execute the Installer script as **root** `cd radiusdesk-installer; ./rd-installer` and walk through the wizard.
3. Grab yourself a **cup of Coffee** as the installer provisions your server with RADIUSdesk.
4. When the script is done installing and configuring your system, we recommend rebooting your machine/server to ensure everything is persistent on reboot.

## Features
1. A wizard for customizing Web server, Database Credentials (Host, User, Password & DB Name) and FreeRADIUS secret 
2. Installer downloads latest copy of RADIUSdesk so that you are always on edge
3. Somewhat modularized, so you can always extend RADIUSdesk installer to support your environment
4. Setup Captive Portal with CoovaChilli

## Compatibility
The installer has been tested on the following Linux Operating Systems
 
1. CentOS 6.4/6.5 (64 bit)  
2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4/6.5 (64 bit) 
3. Ubuntu 13.10/14.04 (64 bit)
