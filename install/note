VMWARE
I found this error when trying to run a Redhat Linux VMware image using the VMware player on my Windows XP operating system.

Unable to open kernel device "\\.\vmci": 
The system cannot find the file specified. 
Did you reboot after installing VMware Player?

After some hours of investigation, I fixed the problem by disabling the VMCI (Virtual Machine Communication Interface) on my virtual machine by doing the following:
1. Open the xxxxxx.vmx file using any text editor.
2. Change the following line:

vmci0.present = "TRUE"

to the following:

vmci0.present = "FALSE"

After applying this workaround, the VMware image worked successfully.
